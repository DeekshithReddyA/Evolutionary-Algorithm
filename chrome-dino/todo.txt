Things to do


-> Chrome-dino and make sure its working correctly, and have buttons to restart the game if game over.
-> implement a neural network which takes in inputs from the game and outputs whether to jump or duck.
   Input -> NN -> 3 nodes (jump/duck/nothing)
-> high chances the neural network training will be a pain.. 
   Sols: Search datasets, or human reinforcement (infeasible) or find a different solution for it.
-> add genetic algorithm
    - multiple dinos should be visible during training phase which each representing their own NN.
    - post training. only one smartest dino(best nn) should be displayed playing the game.
    - store the best neural network. and also the analytics(as many as possible) during the training.
    EXTRA: User should be able to intefere between during inference to check how the neural netwrok behaves.
    (point can be made in research paper too) 



Fixes to make:
-> fix min distance and max distance and tune them according to the speed too.
->
